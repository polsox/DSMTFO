# DSMTFO - Don't sign me the fuck out!

#### The Problem:
> YouTube has a **DUMBASS** button that logs you out of **EVERY SINGLE** google account on **ALL** google services / websites on your browser without giving any confirmation or feedback.

#### The Answer:
> A simple extension that runs a confirmation dialog when you press the button, I originally wanted to move the button as well. But found it difficult, if you have a solution, fork and open a pull request to merge.


#### Future Plans:
> I don't know, if I find other annoyances within YouTube, I might update the extension to do more.
